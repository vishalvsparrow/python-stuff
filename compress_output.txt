All people are inherently harmony seekers, not matter what nationality, race, or religion 100 subscribe to. It is something 001 has been imbibed in the very definition of a mammal 101 strong social powers. If, for 011 of the time, we could surround ourselves 101 people who we never hesitated to talk to about anything, we would slowly get accustomed to opening up about our feelings. Think about a child being brought up in such a system. You could imagine 010 child being surrounded by broadminded and nonchalant members of his family; and having 111 exposure to a sub-part of the society 001 is both chivalrous and considerate, than the dissonant part of it which is the home to 011 of the working class families. You would ideally relate 010 child 101 the common traits of the one who hails from a family of means. ‘What are these traits?’ one may ask. The answer to 001 is a huge list prepared by some psychologist who has spent years researching on 010 subject, but relevant to the present context, I know of one trait 001 would definitely comprise 010 list. And 001 trait is ‘opening up about one’s feelings’. The reason why I am correlating family background 101 the trait of someone opening up about one’s feelings, is because there is a striking similarity between- the number of ears 001 would be willing to listen to 110 feelings if you were a ten year old being raised in a supportive and wealthy family; and the number of ears willing to do the same if you were a twenty year old 101 a harmonious social circle comprising of people who share similar views and values as yours, regardless of 110 net worth. One may also be compelled to ask ‘what does a wealthy family has to do in the example of the ten year old?’ To be concise, the idea of wealth here is portrayed simply as a factor 001 mitigates the probability of a child facing several situations where pecuniary problems of the family hinder the process of attentive parenting. So, to an adult, it ultimately comes down to the question of being perceptible by the social group 100 are a part of. If the answer to 001 question is affirmative, one would see 001 such an adult would 000 no problem expressing their concerns to the people around them. This quality gradually solidifies into a strong verbal or written communication skill 101 the passage of time. Now, the following may hit you as a revelation but there is indeed a place where you can express any of 110 thoughts, no matter what attributes 100 hold, and you can be sure 001 someone, somewhere, is going to respond to them. We call 001 place, ‘the social media’. Indeed, in a way the social media satisfies our carving of being heard, especially dating back to our childhood.A perfect example of 010 phenomenon will be a kid in my neighborhood 001 I had as a teenager. We barely saw each other, but I was aware of the suppressions he had to face by his parents. He was raised rather to be 111 disciplined than expressive. If you were to walk up to him and ask him how he spent his holidays, he would tell you 001 he spent 011 of his free time listening to his parents talking about household concerns, and playing videogames. Years later, 010 child grew up to become an atheist and often posted on Facebook about how disgusted he was about the traditional beliefs held by the majority about God, and stuff like 001. Something had changed. It had nothing to do 101 maturity because not everybody develops a power of expression as 100 grow up. This kid had his prolonged exposure to videogames shift to social networking. As he built his connection 101 111 people who shared his views, his confidence grew better. With approval from around five people on quotidian basis, he was able to reflect on the area he was interested in.The conclusion at the end is 001 if, as an adult, you 000 the right kind of people around who are sure to constantly approve 110 views and rectify 110 flaws, you 000 a better shot at a happier life than 011 people who randomly build their social circle out of their social instincts. To paraphrase 010, people who 000 personality similar to yours are 111 likely to agree 101 you, share 110 interests, and empathize 101 you. This can lead to a post-childhood nurturing 001 is almost impossible to attain by 011 of the adults involved in their monotonous lives.
